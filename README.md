This project showcases authentic recipes, explores regional food cultures, and provides a modern, user-friendly experience for anyone eager to discover African cuisine.

## Features

    *   A stunning hero section with a background image and an introductory video.
    *   A "Featured Dishes" section with quick links to popular recipes.
    *   An "Explore by Region" section for easy navigation.
    *   A "Latest Food Trends" section with news updates.

    *   An ingredients list (`<ul>`).
    *   Expandable cooking instructions using `<details>` and `<summary>`.
    *   An embedded YouTube tutorial video.
